#                                            Summary:
#
# This class is the main event handler for our program. It allows for the managing and creation
# of events and event data, the creation and application of event tags, the creation and editing
# of RSVPs, and the searching of different events through tags, popularity, location,
# and organization.
#
#                                           Data members:
#
# events, oldEvents, setData, saveData
#
#
#                                            Methods:
#
# "init": This is the "constructor" method, it initializes variables and makes calls
# to other classes.
#
# "saveChanges": This method passes data to the "EventIO" class and saves it.
#
# "getEvent": This method returns the name of each event.
#
# "getAllEvents": This short method returns all events to the "EventData" list.
#
# "getOldEvent": Returns an event that has already passed.
#
# "getOldEvents": Returns every out of date event.
#
# "getOneDayEvents": Appends the list by returning all events that start within
# 24 hours.
#
# "addRSVP": Allows users to RSVP by adding them to the event. Has a self check
# which returns "true" if the addition was sucessful.
#
# "removeRSVP": Removes users from the RSVP list, but will not change the organizer. 
# Also contains a self check that will return "true" if the change was sucessful.
#
# "newEvent": Reads user input to create a new event and saves it to the "database". 
# It will first check to see if an event exists with the same name, and will return 
# "true" if the event is sucessfully created.
#
# "removeEvent": Removes an event from the registry, and then updates the "database".
#
# "replaceEvent": Replaces an event, and then updates the "database".
#
# "retireEvent": Locates passed event as a retired event, and updates the "database".
#
# "searchName": Searches the databse for events by name, and returns events with
# matching names.
#
# "searchOrganizer": Searches for events by the specified organizer, and returns
# matching searches.
#
# "searchRSVP": Returns a list of users who RSVP'd to an event.
#
# "searchZIP": Searches for events in the database by ZIP code.
#
# "refineSearchDate": Narrows the search by applying a date parameter.
#
# "searchPopular": Returns the three events with the most RSVPs. 
#
# "refineSearchTags": Narrow the search by applying tags to searched events.
#
# "checkActive": Scans every event and removed passed events.
